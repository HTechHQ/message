// Package message is an (opinionated) interface intended to be copied into your project.
//
// As a project matures, requirements and the technical
// environment evolve, it is painful to realise that deeply embedded
// dependencies like loggers or message systems have to be replaced.
// Thus, it is a helpful practise to hide external libraries behind an
// application specific interface.
